                    <p>At the village the aim is to achieve some level of self-sustainability and there are several micro-projects on the go. There is a solar powered water recycling system which has helped enormously when the boreholes were dry, enabling recycling of grey water. This can be used for washing, flushing the toilets and watering the grass to keep the play area nice for the children. The quality of the water has been tested and has even been passed as clean enough for drinking although there are plenty of other uses for it at the moment. 
                    <br><br>For food supplements, there are small breeding projects of rabbits and chickens and a good size vegetable garden. Three fish ponds for bream have been rejuvenated as an income generating project and also to supply some to the children. It also gives the children a chance to learn how to fish and prepare their catch. It is difficult to provide enough food for 77 children and of course staple diet still needs to be purchased but the micro projects give the children a chance to learn where their food comes from and some nutritious variation in their diet. 
                    <br><br>The largest new project is the St Marcellin&apos;s Primary School. This originally got started as a home school set up to provide a more personalised education to the children who have had such a disadvantaged start and performed poorly in large classes where they were left behind. The school was temporarily based in one of the houses with three dedicated primary school teachers, but in January 2014 a purpose built fully registered school, funded by the Italian Asociation Spagnolli Bazzoni, was proudly opened. The school has Grades 1-7 to prepare the children for secondary High School.</p>
