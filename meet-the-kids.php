                    <h2>Meet The Kids</h2>
                    <p>St Marcellin Childrens' Village was established in 2002 to care for orphaned and homeless children in need. Many of the children have special physical and emotional needs, but in the supportive and loving environment of the village, the happiness of the children shines through. By 2011 the number of children in the Village had risen to seventy six, mostly children received through the Government Department of Child Welfare. As a registered organisation, the Village is regulated by the Department of Child Welfare, who provide supervisory visits and limited medical advice.</p>
