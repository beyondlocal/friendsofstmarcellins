                    <h2>How You Can Help</h2>
                    <p>St Marcellin Children's Village needs regular funds to continue to provide a stable environment with basic food, healthcare and education to the ever growing number of children who are in need. Whilst basic foods may be donated, the children's diet needs enrichment with nutrient rich foods and micronutrient supplementation. There are many children with special needs who need specialised support in the pre-school and nursery and funds are needed to provide them with stimulation and support. Many children need specialised healthcare.</p>
                    <h3>What you can do</h3>
                    <p>Whilst it is important to get projects funded it is also essential to raise maintenance funds to keep vital staff employed such as housemothers who care for the children in their house environment and the teachers employed in the home school. If you think you can do any event to help raise funds for the village, please contact us. If you shop online, you can help by accessing your favourite retailers through the Giving Machine and we will receive donations each time you shop. Just go to <a href="http://www.thegivingmachine.co.uk/">www.thegivingmachine.co.uk</a> and nominate Friends of St Marcellins Children as your chosen charity
                    <br><br>
                    You can <a href="/donate.php">support a child, a teacher or a nurse</a> to work at St Marcellin's, or donate towards school uniforms and educational fees. Whatever you give will be used to provide the children with a loving, healthy, safe and educational environment. At the moment we are looking for funds to supply the resources for the primary school which has just started to be constructed. It is planned to have a sewing room, art area and a hall for drama and music. Sport equipment is also required.

                    At the moment, we are <a href="/donate.php">looking for funds</a> to build a primary school on site to educate the children. Please <a href="/contact-us.php">contact us</a> if you can help with this very important project.</p>
