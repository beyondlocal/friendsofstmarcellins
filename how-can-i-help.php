                    <h2>How You Can Help</h2>
                    <p>St Marcellin Children&apos;s Village needs regular funds to continue to provide a stable environment for the children with basic food, healthcare and education. Food is expensive in Zimbabwe and feeding 77 children, especially hungry teenagers takes a huge part of the budget. There are several children with special needs who need specialised support in the pre-school and funds are needed to provide them with stimulation and support. Many children need specialised healthcare due to disabilities or chronic conditions such as HIV. With the increasing age of the children in the village, more and more are graduating to High School which is an enormous expense. Education is the only way to improve the future for these children and whilst expensive we endeavour to support all the children through their secondary education.</p>
                    <h3>What you can do</h3>
                    <p>Whilst it is important to get projects funded it is also essential to raise maintenance funds to keep vital staff employed such as housemothers who care for the children in their house environment and experienced professional teachers in the school. If you think you can do any event to help raise funds for the village, please contact us. If you shop online, you can help by accessing your favourite retailers through the Giving Machine and we will receive donations each time you shop. Just go to <a href="http://www.thegivingmachine.co.uk/">www.thegivingmachine.co.uk</a> and nominate Friends of St Marcellins Children as your chosen charity.

                    <br><br>

                    You can <a href="/donate.php">support a child, a teacher or a nurse</a> to work at St Marcellin's, or donate towards school uniforms and educational fees. We are looking for additional funds to expand the school with a sewing room, art area and a hall for drama and music. Whatever you give will be used to provide the children with a loving, healthy, safe and educational environment. 

                    The new project that we would love to get off the ground is to raise funds to build a skills centre. The idea is to teach the children practical skills for the workplace such as carpentry, mechanics, etc. This is becoming more and more urgent as the children are hitting their teenage years and also as it becomes clear that many will always struggle with the academic side of learning and that giving them a practical skill is the best way forward.
